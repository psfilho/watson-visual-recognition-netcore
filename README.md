Watson Visual Recognition SDK &amp; Tool for .NET Core

[Live Demo](http://watson-visual-recognition-tool.mybluemix.net/)

This project consists of an abstraction SDK from Watson's Visual Recognition api's for .NetCore and web project utility for the management and classification of images.

## SDK

The SDK was developed using .NetCore, and is intended to facilitate the use of the Visual Recognition API for .NET developers, allowing the the use of face detection, image classification and managing custom classifiers in a fast and easy way

## Utility

The utility was developed above the SDK mentioned above, and using ASP.NET and AngularJS to create a simple and friendly interface.

With this utility, it is intended that anyone, regardless of machine learning or programming knowledge, can use the benefits of visual recognition.

Examples:

* A dealership can use the utility to search for the car model with just one photo.

* A clothing store can take the photo of a dress and find similar products.

* A biologist can identify specimens of animals with just the photo of it.

* Hospitals can diagnose imaging tests by comparing them to other tests.

All of this without writing any line code or having a T.I. team to implement the solution. Only using the [Live Demo](http://watson-visual-recognition-tool.mybluemix.net/)
